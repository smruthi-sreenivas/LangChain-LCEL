# LangChain-LCEL Demo

A minimal demo notebook showcasing a simple three-model ensemble pipeline using LangChain and Cohere to generate and merge responses.

ðŸ§  What It Does
Sends the same prompt (your question) to two Cohere models independently

Uses a third model to combine the two responses into one coherent answer

Employs LangChainâ€™s prompt templating and chaining for easy model orchestration
